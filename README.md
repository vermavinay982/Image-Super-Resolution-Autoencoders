# Increase_Resolution_AutoEncoder
They were invented to help
1. Hidden layer to learn more robust features
2. Reduce risk of overfitting in autoencoder
3. Prevent autoencoder to learn a simple identity function (that would make it just repeat what is entered into the input)

## Features of AutoEncoder
1. Denoise the image using DeepLearning
2. Anomaly Detection with Keras, Tensorflow, Deep Learning
3. Compressing the image to a latent space
